# Selenium Web Browser Automation Scripts 🌐✨

## STAR Approach

### Situation 🌍

In response to the increasing demand for efficient and reliable web browser automation testing, this repository was created. The need arose from a specific assignment available at [Techlistic](https://www.techlistic.com/2021/10/selenium-web-browser-automation.html). The assignment focused on Selenium-based web browser automation and presented an opportunity to develop a robust testing solution.

### Task 📋

The task involved addressing the Techlistic assignment, which required the creation of automation testing scripts using Selenium, Python, and Pytest. The primary goal was to automate various web interactions and validate the functionality of a web application. The specific assignment details can be found [here](https://www.techlistic.com/2021/10/selenium-web-browser-automation.html).

### Action 🚀

To fulfill this task, a series of Selenium scripts were meticulously developed. The STAR approach (Situation, Task, Action, Result) was employed to guide the development process:

1. **Install Python (v3.5+):**
   - Ensure a Python environment of version 3.5 or higher is set up on the testing system.

2. **Install Pip:**
   - Utilize the pip package manager to install necessary Python packages.

3. **Download ChromeDriver:**
   - Download the specific version of ChromeDriver required for the assignment from [here](https://chromed
